##1 Print the number of integers in an array that are above the given input and the number that are below, e.g. for the array [1, 5, 2, 1, 10] with input 6, print “above: 1, below: 4”.

in my opinion the simplest solution to this task will be using the for a loop and compere each item to the given number using if statement.
my solution is above.

## 2 Rotate the characters in a string by a given input and have the overflow appear at the beginning, e.g. “MyString” rotated by 2 is “ngMyStri”.
I am provided 2 solutions to this Task. The first one takes lass space, I used the string methods.
the second one I have provided for better explanation, what is the logic behind the substring method.

## 3 If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?
I would change a bit JavaScript.For me the most inconvenient aspect of JS at this point of my knowledge it is arrow functions, and function declarations. I would rather them to have the same behavior.
However, generally speaking, at this point of my carrier I don't think that I have enough knowledge to make any conclusions.
